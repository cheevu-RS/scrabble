The famous word game - [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble)!

Backend -> [repository](https://github.com/hrishikeshshekhar/scrabble-backend)

### Motivation
I was hooked to scrabble for a while during the quarantine and wanted to make a bot to find the optimal word that can be placed at every stage. 
This, combined with the lack of a free online place (that is pleasing to the eye) to play scrabble online with your friends led me to start working on this project.
